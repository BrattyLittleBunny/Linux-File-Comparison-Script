Simple bash script that will recursively check all files from a specified directory, outputs it into a file, then compares this scan to your previous one, and outputs a file with all the differences in between them. real simple. 

i wanted to make this for a bit, but adhd kept putting it off, cause i'm paranoid somethings changing stuff on my computer.

Hope it helps anyone!!!
:D
